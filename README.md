# Information:

Work in progress.

Create a rpg card game and network test build?

# Notes paths:
 Love2D has some path fixed to format.

 On windows OS it fixed to project folder and %AppData%  > /Roaming/love/<projectname if set in config>
 
 The reason is the Androind and IOS path is fixed to their own app folder not allow out their app folder without permission access.
